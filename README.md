## 5E - Character Sheet Reaction

This is an extension for Fantasy Grounds that adds a tickbox to the 5E character sheet for
tracking reaction. It is tied to the reaction field in the combat tracker under "offensive".

This has been tested with Fantasy Grounds Unity. I'm not sure if it works for Fantasy Grounds
Classic.
